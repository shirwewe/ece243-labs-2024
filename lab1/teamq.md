### PART I

1. How far in advance do you like to have finished your preparation for a lab? The night before, two days
before, or more?


- I will start the lab as soon as it's released as long as there's no midterm within 24 hours of lab release. My goal is to finish it the Friday before the Monday lab so we can test it on Friday at the Bahen Lab. So it will generally look like: 
    - Saturday - Monday: start new lab
    - Tuesday - Thursday:  Debug Debug Debug
    - Friday - Test 

2. How do you like to interact with a partner - in person, online, or a mixture?


- Definitely a mixture. Whenever there is time post lecture or inbetween lecture (I'm a firm believer of using snippets of spare time) we can work in-person at the Bahen lab, otherwise we can make online calls and discuss code as well. 


3. What is your personal approach to resolving disagreements - for example, do your prefer to raise issues in
person, or by email/message? Are you unlikely to bring up issues because you donâ€™t like conflict, or do you
like to discuss issues as soon as they arise, or something in between?


- Both discussing in person and through text is ok, it's always better to raise issues than to not. Don't be shy just say it to my face I always appreciate the honesty. Also do it as soon as possible, even if you're just the slightest concern about our work dynamic. I will also likely say what I don't think is working well upfront so please bear with me. I look forward to working with you!
